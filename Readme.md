  Android Studio/IntelliJ havea special kind of code completion which allows you to write code specific to a field
  + `<expr>.null` will auto complete to `if(<expr> == null)`
  + `<expr>.nootnull` will auto complete to `if(<expr> != null)`
  + `<expr>.var` will auto complete to `T name = <expr>`
  + `<expr>.field` will auto complete to create a global field variable `field = <expr>`
  + `<ArrayExpr>.for` will auto complete to `for(T item : <Arrayexpr>)`
  + `<ArrayExpr>.fori` will auto complete to `for(int i = 0; i < <Arrayexpr>.length; i++)`
  + `<ArrayExpr>.forr` will auto complete to `for(int i = <Arrayexpr>.length - 1; i > 0 ; i--)`

  Complete list of available postfix code completion can be found at: **Settings → Editor → Postfix Templates**

## Gradle

+ **Use shrinkResources**
  ```gradle
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            shrinkResources true
            minifyEnabled true
            ...
        }
    }
  }
  ```

+ **Split your apk using gradle when using Native code, do not bundle all of em together and ship!.. coz that will make you evil**

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      ...

      ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi", "armeabi-v7a", "mips", "x86"
      }
    }

  //Split into platform dependent APK
  splits {
    abi {
      enable true
      reset()
      include 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'mips', 'x86' //select ABIs to build APKs for
      universalApk false //generate an additional APK that contains all the ABIs
    }
  }

  // map for the version code
  project.ext.versionCodes = ['armeabi': 1, 'armeabi-v7a': 2, 'mips': 5, 'x86': 8]

  // Rename with proper versioning
  android.applicationVariants.all { variant ->
    // assign different version code for each output
    variant.outputs.each { output ->
      output.versionCodeOverride =
          project.ext.versionCodes.get(output.getFilter(com.android.build.OutputFile.ABI), 0) *
              1000000 +
              android.defaultConfig.versionCode
    }
  }
  ```

+ **To force re-download of dependencies**

  ```gradle
  ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
  ```
  
+ **To exclude a certain task from being run by gradle**

  Suppose you want to exclude the task `javaDoc` then use `-x` option followed by the task name, i.e `javaDoc` in this case.

  ```gradle
  ./gradlew clean build -x javaDoc
  ```
+ **To have the each subproject script name match that of the project name**

  Then add this line in settings.gradle

  ```gradle
  rootProject.children.each{
    it.buildFileName = it.name + '.gradle'
  }
  ```

  **[Checkout more gradle tips here](https://github.com/shekhargulati/gradle-tips)**

+ **Use different package name for non-release builds**
  ```gradle
    android {
        buildTypes {
            debug {
                applicationIdSuffix '.debug'
                versionNameSuffix '-DEBUG'
            }

            release {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
  ```

+ **[If you’re creating a gradient in xml with a part being completely transparent, be really careful when using `@android:color/transparent`](https://android.jlelse.eu/android-dev-tip-3-99da754151ad#.clbqzz3zh)**

+ **[Follow a standard naming convention for your resources](http://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/03/07/resourcenaming/)**

+ **Make use of custom gradle tasks in your build.gradle files**

  Android uses Gradle as its build system, which actually allows one to make a lot of things easy by creating tasks to automate things.
  [This reddit post enlists a lot of such useful gradle scripts](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3ig3gm/show_us_your_gradle_tasks)

+ **Stop a running gradle build process**

    ```bash
    ./gradlew -stop
    ```

+ **Donot include both `jcenter()` & `mavenCentral()` in your `build.gradle` file**

  JCenter is a superset of MavenCentral. [[Ref tweet]](https://twitter.com/molsjeroen/status/791606774210199553)

+ **Clear your gradle cache if you think that bundled support and google play services lib in android sdk are inconsistent**

  + Goto `~/.gradle/caches/` and delete everything inside the `cache` folder.
  + Open SDK Manager and resync all support libs and google play services
  + Next re-sync your project
  + Everything should become consistent and functional.

+ **Setup handy `adb` aliases for your terminal** [[Ref Link]](https://medium.com/@jonfhancock/bash-your-way-to-better-android-development-1169bc3e0424#.8zcc4m5ch)

  Append the below **Aliases** to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, save and restart the terminal. Once saved, use them as show in **Usage** column

  |Alias|Usage
  |---|---
  |`alias screenshot="adb exec-out screencap -p > screen-$(date -j "+%s").png"`|`screenshot`
  |`alias startintent="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell am start $1"`|`startintent https://twitter.com/nisrulz`
  |`alias apkinstall="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X install -r $1"`|`apkinstall ~/Desktop/DemoApp.apk`
  |`alias rmapp="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X uninstall $1"`|`rmapp com.example.demoapp`
  |`alias clearapp="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell pm clear $1"`|`clearapp com.example.demoapp`

+ **Setup Android Studio to fail build if code contains `//STOPSHIP`** [[Ref Link]](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5c8b0a/i_know_android_studio_allows_you_to_make_custom/d9uhdzt/)

  To enable the `//STOPSHIP` lint check, in your `build.gradle`

  ```gradle
  android {
  ...
      lintOptions {
          abortOnError true
          fatal 'StopShip'
      }
  }
  ```
  If you have a `//STOPSHIP` comment in your code, this will cause an error to be thrown when a release apk is generated.
  > You can turn on //STOPSHIP highlighting in Android Studio (isn't enabled by default) in
  >
  >  `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Inspections`.
  >
  > Search for STOPSHIP to find the correct setting.

+ **Use `adb install -g` to grant all permissions listed in the manifest** [[More Info]](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html)

+ **Use [`alfi`](https://github.com/cesarferreira/alfi) to find the gradle dependency statement for a library**

  >Its basically the command line version of [Gradle, Please](gradleplease.appspot.com) which is a web hosted.

  + Run

    ```bash
    alfi name_of_library
    ```
  + Copy the desired library
  + Paste in your build.gradle

+ **Use [`dryrun`](https://github.com/cesarferreira/dryrun) to test a library directly**

  + Just Run

    ```bash
    dryrun REMOTE_GIT_URL
    ```
+ **Output unit tests directly to the console** [[Ref Link]](https://medium.com/@cesarmcferreira/mastering-the-terminal-side-of-android-development-e7520466c521#.1cw4bto7f)

  > A small neat trick to see Android unit tests logging results as they happen in the terminal.

  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      testOptions.unitTests.all {
        testLogging {
          events 'passed', 'skipped', 'failed', 'standardOut', 'standardError'
          outputs.upToDateWhen { false }
          showStandardStreams = true
        }
      }
    }
  ```

+ **Reduce installed app size with `"android:extractNativeLibs:false"` in `<application>`** [[Ref Link]](https://medium.com/@wkalicinski/smallerapk-part-8-native-libraries-open-from-apk-fc22713861ff#.bajqmlshi)

  > This will essentially prevent the system from creating a second copy of the .so files and fix the System.loadLibrary call so it’s able to find and open native libs straight from the APK, no code changes on your part required.

+ **Selectivily execute a specific method in Android Studio** [[Ref Link]](https://twitter.com/tasomaniac/status/820019068140945408)

	![Image](img/selectiverun.gif)

+ **Did you get one of these Google Play Developer Policy Violation Emails? Worry not, generate a Privacy Policy for your android app** [[Ref ink]](https://medium.com/@ali.muzaffar/did-you-get-one-of-these-google-play-developer-policy-violation-emails-6c529ceb082d#.f10upj3fy)
    + Take a look at [App Privacy Policy Generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/), a web app to generate a generic privacy policy for your app.

+ **Define a variable at build time**
  In your `build.gradle` 

  ```gradle
  android{
    defaultConfig {
      ...
      buildConfigField "String", "SERVER_ENDPOINT", '"http://www.myendpoint.com"'
      buildConfigField "int", "FOO", "52"
      buildConfigField "boolean", "LOG", "false"
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
  and then use it in code as `BuildConfig.SERVER_ENDPOINT`, `BuildConfig.FOO`,`BuildConfig.LOG`

+ **Calculate the version code and version name in your `build.gradle` ***manually***, based of version values***
  In your app's `build.gradle` 

  ```gradle
  versionMajor = 0
  versionMinor = 0
  versionPatch = 0
  versionBuild = 1


  verCode = versionMajor * 1000000 + versionMinor * 10000 + versionPatch * 100 + versionBuild
  verName = "${versionMajor}.${versionMinor}.${versionPatch}"

  // Use
  android{
    defaultConfig {
      ...
      versionCode verCode
      versionName verName
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

+ **Calculate the version code and version name in your `build.gradle` ***automatically***, based on git information***
  
  > Note: These functions go specifically inside the app's `build.gradle` and cannot be used with `ext`.

  In your app's `build.gradle` 

  ```gradle
  // Version code is calculated as the number of commits from last commit on master
  def getVersionCode = { ->
    try {
      def code = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
      exec {
        commandLine 'git', 'rev-list', 'HEAD', '--count'
        standardOutput = code
      }
      return Integer.parseInt(code.toString().trim())
    } catch (exception) {
      return "1";
    }
  }

  // Version name is Last Tag Name + No. of commits form last Tag +  short git sha
  def getVersionName = { ->
    try {
      def stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
      exec {
        commandLine 'git', 'describe', '--tags', '--dirty'
        standardOutput = stdout
      }
      return stdout.toString().trim()
    } catch (exception) {
      return "0.0.0.1";
    }
  }

  // Use
  android{
    defaultConfig {
      ...
      versionCode getVersionCode()
      versionName getVersionName()
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

+ **Get the date of build as a variable***
  In your app's `build.gradle` 

  ```gradle
  // Get the date of build
  def getDateOfBuild = { -> // ISO 8601 time format
    return new Date().format("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm'Z'").toString().trim()
  }

  // then use it as a variable in BuildConfig
  android{
    defaultConfig {
      ...
      buildConfigField "String", "DATE_OF_BUILD", "\"${getDateOfBuild()}\""
    }
  }
  ```

+ **Get the Git SHA as a variable***
  In your app's `build.gradle` 

  ```gradle
  // Get the last Git Short Hash
  def getGitHash = { ->
    def stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
    exec {
      commandLine 'git', 'rev-parse', '--short', 'HEAD'
      standardOutput = stdout
    }
    return stdout.toString().trim()
  }

  // then use it as a variable in BuildConfig
  android{
    defaultConfig {
      ...
      buildConfigField "String", "GIT_SHA", "\"${getGitHash()}\""
    }
  }
  ```

+ **Activity LifeCycle** [[Ref Link](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/android-activity-lifecycle-onStop/)]

  ![diagram](img/activityStateDiagram.jpeg)
  
+ **Tip about `onSaveInstanceState()`**  
  `onSaveInstanceState()` is called **_only when the OS decides to kill the `Activity` instance_**. It will not be called when Activity is explicitly killed i.e User pressed back button or `finish()` is called from code.

## UI/UX


### Motion
- Material Design uses real-world metaphors as its foundation. Objects in the real world don't move linearly, they move in curved paths and accelerate and decelerate according to the motion's properties.
- As such, motion should also use such properties and animate objects so that the motion feels natural rather than forced
- For example, a car leaving the screen in a movie starts off slowly, then accelerates till it's out of the frame. Similarly, views should be interpolated using classes like AccelerateInterpolator, FastOutSlowInInterpolator, etc. [[More Info]](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/TimeInterpolator.html)

### Typography
- While custom typefaces can be used for branding, it is essential to stick to Roboto and Noto if possible, especially for body text, due to their clarity and optimistic nature.
- Roboto covers Latin, Greek and Cyrillic extended scripts, with Noto filling in for other language scripts [[More Info]](https://material.google.com/style/typography.html#)
- Weight balancing is an important aspect of typography, the fundamental concept of which is that the larger a typeface is, the less its weight should be so that it doesn't appear too thick and balances its weight with smaller typefaces of higher weights
- Typography should align to a 4dp baseline grid, and maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 based on luminance values, with a recommended ratio being 7:1.
- The ideal reading length for large blocks of text is 40 to 60 characters per line. Anything less is too narrow and anything more is too wide.

### Icons
- Icons should be designed at 48dp, with 1dp edges, which equates to
    - 48px by 48px at mdpi
    - 72px by 72px at hdpi
    - 96px by 96px at xhdpi
    - 144px by 144px at xxhdpi
    - 192px by 192px at xxxhdpi
- An additional icon of 512px by 512px should be designed for use on Google Play
- Material icons, in addition to the base icon, should contain the following important elements
    - 1dp tinted edge at the top
    - 1dp shaded edge at the bottom
    - Contact shadow - a soft shadow around all edges of raised elements
    - Finish - a soft tint to provide surface lighting, fading from upper life to lower right [[More Info]](https://material.google.com/style/icons.html#icons-product-icons)

### Ripples
- When implementing Ripple Effect use `?attr/selectableItemBackground` instead of `?android:attr` ([Ref](https://twitter.com/pareshmayani/status/772061422729637893))
- When implementing Ripples contained within the view like Button, use ([Ref](https://twitter.com/pareshmayani/status/772268888931176448))
```xml
android:background="?attr/selectableItemBackground"
```
- When implementing Ripples that extend beyond the view's bounds like ImageView: ([Ref](https://twitter.com/pareshmayani/status/772269413290520576))
```xml
?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless
```
    
### Other
- Views should be aligned to Material Design's 8dp baseline grid and the keylines when possible. This gives the UI a sense of structure and hierarchy. [[More Info]](https://material.google.com/layout/metrics-keylines.html)
- If you plan on keeping a reference to any ViewGroup (LinearLayout, FrameLayout, RelativeLayout, etc.), and you don’t want to use any methods specific to this particular type of Layout, keep it as a ViewGroup object. [[More Info]](https://android.jlelse.eu/android-pro-tip-1-443f423b4de6#.pklc9djmc)
- While picking an accent color (if the brand already has one), pick a color complementary to the primary color so that the contrast is high enough
